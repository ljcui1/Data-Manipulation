Input Guide:
- mouse click can invert the colors on some patches of the image
- SPACEBAR will slide the image to the left
- ENTER shuffles all of the pixels randomly
- "A" will lower the brightness
- "D" will raise the brightness

Images can be inputted at the beginning of runtime.

Artistic Intent:
I was hoping to make a sort of editing tool that could be a user-friendly way of adding certain effects to the image so users could just click or press a key instead of needing to code. Initially, I was going to go a less creative route by just making a classic tool that could just change the HSB values but it didn't really have an interesting effect and it can be achieved through so many other tools. Instead, I opted to just choose a random selection of effects that, given the user's creative freedom, an interesting and glitchy looking image could be made. I'm impressed with my results but I'm not quite as happy about it as I could be since the resulting image really is not that interesting. The results were as expected but I would be interested in implementing more.
